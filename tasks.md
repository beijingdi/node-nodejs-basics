You should implement several functions in dedicated files
- `create.js` - implement function that creates new file `fresh.txt` with content `I am fresh and young` inside of the `files` folder (if file already exists `Error` with message `FS operation failed` must be thrown)
- `copy.js` - implement function that copies folder `files` files with all its content into folder `files_copy` at the same level (if `files` folder doesn't exists or `files_copy` has already been created `Error` with message `FS operation failed` must be thrown)
- `rename.js` - implement function that renames file `wrongFilename.txt` to `properFilename` with extension `.md` (if there's no file `wrongFilename.txt` or `properFilename.md` already exists `Error` with message `FS operation failed` must be thrown)

- `delete.js` - implement function that deletes file `fileToRemove.txt` (if there's no file `fileToRemove.txt` `Error` with message `FS operation failed` must be thrown)


- `list.js` - implement function that prints all array of filenames from `files` folder into console (if `files` folder doesn't exists `Error` with message `FS operation failed` must be thrown)


- `read.js` - implement function that prints content of the `fileToRead.txt` into console (if there's no file `fileToRead.txt` `Error` with message `FS operation failed` must be thrown)
